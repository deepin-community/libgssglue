This library exports a gssapi interface, but doesn't implement any gssapi
mechanisms itself; instead it calls gssapi routines in other libraries,
depending on the mechanism.

The library requires C99 (stdint.h etc) and POSIX (sys/types.h,
unistd.h etc) and should work on all modern Unix-like platforms.
